As a defense, the Browns had 11 hits on \u003cstrong\u003eMason Rudolph\u003c/strong\u003e (well, 12 if you count the helmet hit). 8 of those hits came from the defensive line. 5 of those hits were from two players facing suspension now (2 for \u003cstrong\u003eLarry Ogunjobi\u003c/strong\u003e, 3 for \u003cstrong\u003eMyles Garrett\u003c/strong\u003e).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\nOgunjobi and Garrett have been playing a ton of snaps all season. Since \u003cstrong\u003eOlivier Vernon’s\u003c/strong\u003e injury a couple of weeks ago, \u003cstrong\u003eChad Thomas\u003c/strong\u003e has filled in and played way above my expectations (including logging another sack this week and almost having an interception). The problem is that Cleveland really doesn’t have a long-term option to replace those snaps in the starting lineup.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIdeally, Vernon would come back from his knee injury this week, but when he’ll return is still a question mark. Is veteran \u003cstrong\u003eChris Smith\u003c/strong\u003e going to get most of Garrett’s snaps (actually, Thomas would shift over)? Smith is good for depth, but as a starter, that’s a hefty downgrade. The same goes for Ogunjobi up front. \u003cstrong\u003eSheldon Richardson\u003c/strong\u003e is the only starter in tact right now; I’d expect some works for this week’s game in Miami.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n  \n    \u003ch3\u003eLinebacker\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \n  \u003ctable\u003e\n    \n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003ePos\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003ePlayer\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003ePlays\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003e%\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003eStats\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \n    \n      \u003ctr\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003ePos\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003ePlayer\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003ePlays\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003e%\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n          \u003cth\u003eStats\u003c/th\u003e\n        \n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n    \n    \n      \n        \u003ctr\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003eLB\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003eJoe Schobert\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003e74\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003e100%\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003e7 tackles, 3 assists (10 combined). 1 sack, 2 TFL, 2 QH, 2 INT, 4 passes defended.\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \n        \u003ctr\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003eLB\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003eMack Wilson\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003e74\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003e100%\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003e1 tackle, 4 assists (5 combined). 1 pass defended.\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \n        \u003ctr\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003eLB\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003eSione Takitaki\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003e6\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003e8%\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n            \u003ctd\u003eNo stats registered.\u003c/td\u003e\n          \n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \n    \n  \u003c/table\u003e\n  \n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis was an amazing game for \u003cstrong\u003eJoe Schobert\u003c/strong\u003e, who filled up the stat sheet in impressive fashion.

The Steelers had no offensive players (with experience) left, so they wisely took the approach of chucking the ball down the sideline and hoping for a catch or interference. Williams was flagged once for it, but was borderline on a few other plays, and against better receivers, would have allowed the big catches. He needs to get his head snapped around more on those plays to locate the ball. On the bright side, his run defense has been great.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\u003e#Browns Greedy Williams has been solid in run support and tackling so far this season.

Defensive Line Pos Player Plays % Stats Pos Player Plays % Stats DL Larry Ogunjobi 63 85% 1 tackle (1 combined). 1 sack, 1 TFL, 2 QH. DL Myles Garrett 57 77% 1 tackle (1 combined). 3 QH. DL Chad Thomas 57 77% 3 tackles (3 combined). 1 sack, 1 TFL, 1 QH, 1 pass defended. DL Sheldon Richardson 49 66% 2 tackles, 1 assist (3 combined). 1 QH. DL Chris Smith 29 39% 1 assist (1 combined). 1 QH. DL Devaroe Lawrence 28 38% No stats registered. DL Eli Ankou 13 18% 1 tackle (1 combined). 1 TFL. There is a lot to sort through here. As a defense, the Browns had 11 hits on Mason Rudolph (well, 12 if you count the helmet hit). 8 of those hits came from the defensive line. 5 of those hits were from two players facing suspension now (2 for Larry Ogunjobi , 3 for Myles Garrett ). Ogunjobi and Garrett have been playing a ton of snaps all season. Since Olivier Vernon’s injury a couple of weeks ago, Chad Thomas has filled in and played way above my expectations (including logging another sack this week and almost having an interception). The problem is that Cleveland really doesn’t have a long-term option to replace those snaps in the starting lineup. Ideally, Vernon would come back from his knee injury this week, but when he’ll return is still a question mark. Is veteran Chris Smith going to get most of Garrett’s snaps (actually, Thomas would shift over)? Smith is good for depth, but as a starter, that’s a hefty downgrade. The same goes for Ogunjobi up front. Sheldon Richardson is the only starter in tact right now; I’d expect some works for this week’s game in Miami. Linebacker Pos Player Plays % Stats Pos Player Plays % Stats LB Joe Schobert 74 100% 7 tackles, 3 assists (10 combined). 1 sack, 2 TFL, 2 QH, 2 INT, 4 passes defended. LB Mack Wilson 74 100% 1 tackle, 4 assists (5 combined). 1 pass defended. LB Sione Takitaki 6 8% No stats registered. This was an amazing game for Joe Schobert , who filled up the stat sheet in impressive fashion. Take a look at what PFF said about his performance: The #Browns highest-graded player* on defense vs. #Steelers was Joe Schobert. He posted an elite 93.2 defensive grade and 91.4 coverage grade. He had two INTs and a PBU in coverage, allowing a passer rating of just 22.4 *min. 25 snaps pic.twitter.com/PQqbN51wBW — PFF CLE Browns (@PFF_Browns) November 15, 2019 Sione Takitaki played 6 snaps on defense, staying ahead of Adarius Taylor on the depth chart. Cornerback Pos Player Plays % Stats Pos Player Plays % Stats CB Denzel Ward 74 100% 4 tackles (4 combined). 1 pass defended. CB Greedy Williams 73 99% 6 tackles, 1 assist (7 combined). 1 TFL. CB T.J. Carrie 63 85% 1 tackle (1 combined). CB Tavierre Thomas 1 1% No stats registered. He may not have been flagged a lot, so the stat sheet won’t show it, but this was a pretty rough game for Greedy Williams . The Steelers had no offensive players (with experience) left, so they wisely took the approach of chucking the ball down the sideline and hoping for a catch or interference.
