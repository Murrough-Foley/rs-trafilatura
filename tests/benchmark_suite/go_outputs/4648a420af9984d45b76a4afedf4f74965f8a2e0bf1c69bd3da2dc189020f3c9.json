Here’s what he had to say…\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Junior – We are so excited to have you as our new President and CEO. When you woke up that first morning and you were officially in charge, what are two words to describe how it felt?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: Inspired and humbled! To be in this role, for this awesome company, at this particular time, is tremendous. Words cannot describe how much I love Experience and am honored to be here serving as President and CEO. There has been a lot of change in the live entertainment and ticketing industry over the past six years since I joined the company. Being able to play a role in that change has been a lot of fun. I wake up every day looking forward to coming to work as Experience is impacting the next wave of innovation in the industry. Also, our products, people and partners are top notch and inspire me each and every day!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What’s the one thing you’ve learned in your past roles that is the most helpful as CEO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: I think the importance of empathetic listening to truly understand where a person is coming from is the biggest lesson I’ve learned. I would also add being comfortable making decisions with imperfect information is critical. You must be data driven when evaluating where to go and what to do, but in a rapidly evolving market, you’re never going to always have 100 percent complete information. When that happens, you have to be comfortable with that reality and be prepared to make decisions regardless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How do you prioritize your day?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: I have been well served in my career by using Steven Covey’s The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People as a guide. One of the habits – “Put first things first”, ensures I keep the things that are most important and urgent at the top of the list. I also use Wunderlist as a tool for knocking out smaller items on the to-do list. I block time for meetings and separate time for emails so I’m not back and forth all day and can stay focused on the task at hand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe best thing about Experience are the people who work here and our outstanding 350 partners - you couldn’t ask for better of either. Our employees are smart, dedicated, and enthusiastic, I’m honored to serve them every day as we continue on this journey to change the ticketing industry. Our partners are innovative, collaborative and willing to try new things with us, which is priceless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What’s on the horizon for the business?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: We are moving subscription access to the next level with our direct to consumer offering called INWEGO which offers unlimited access to tickets for a flat fee each month. Also, we are working directly with partners to create a dedicated area of their venue for subscription access. This idea of a section just for subscription is a new take and one that we think will change the industry and ticketing forever. Our product will also be using data in a new way to be more prescriptive and predictive. Our partners will be able to target fans with more relevant offers and experiences and we’ll be much more intelligent about fan preferences and profiles. No one else can combine the technology, a proven track record and relationships like Experience – we can’t wait to roll this out, so stay tuned!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: So far in your journey, tell me one thing that has surprised you the most?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: Being President and CEO requires that you look at all facets of the business each and every day. The thing that has been most surprising is the number of constituents you have and the need to invest in those relationships regularly. This is something I knew intellectually coming into the role, but the need to balance the internal and external relationships with employees, clients, strategic partners, media, etc.. requires a clear plan and direct approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: In reading the SportsBusiness Journal, it was noted that you’ve been named a 40 Under 40 Award recipient. Congratulations!!! What’s it like to be named a 40 Under 40?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: I am very honored to be on the SBJ 40 Under 40 list. It’s a very prestigious group of folks this year – and in years past – and I am so appreciative of the recognition. I thank my family and the wonderful people I work with for their encouragement and support.
