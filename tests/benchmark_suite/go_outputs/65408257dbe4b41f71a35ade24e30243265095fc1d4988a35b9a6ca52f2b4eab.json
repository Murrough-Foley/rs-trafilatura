Experts and brokerages are of the view that the market is factoring in a recovery in the economy. \"The market and the quality part of the market are largely factoring in a reasonable recovery in the economy and earnings,\" said a report from Kotak Institutional Equities. A key reason for the market rally is the improved September quarter earnings. The September quarter earnings were not a complete disappointment, as most of the companies reported in-line or better than expected results.
