That prompted authorities to put him on suicide watch. He was removed from suicide monitoring days later, which has drawn investigative interest. Experts on jail suicide told USA TODAY that an inmate can be removed from suicide watch only if a licensed mental health professional concludes the inmate is no longer at risk for attempting suicide. “When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,\" said Lisa Boesky, a clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert from San Diego. Boesky said Epstein was still \"a high risk for suicide\" because of the nature of his crimes, the humiliation he experienced after his arrest and his prior suicide attempt. Jack Scarola, who represents some of Epstein’s accusers, said he's pleased to see authorities investigate the circumstances of his death. “Forty-five years of practicing law,\" he said, \"has convinced me that there are no coincidences.” Contributing: Kristine Phillips","metadata":{"author":"Kevin Johnson; Kevin McCoy","categories":null,"date":"2019-11-19T00:00:00Z","description":"","hostname":"www.usatoday.com","license":"","sitename":"USA TODAY","tags":null,"title":"Prison guards charged in connection with Jeffrey Epstein's death","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/19/prison-guards-arrested-alleged-failure-check-jeffrey-epstein/4082679002/"}}
