The 55-year-old is the third Beijing resident to contract the medieval disease dubbed the Black Death, say officials. Health bosses said that 28 people in close contact with the hunter were initially quarantined to stop it being transmitted further. The man told doctors he ate the rabbit meat in Inner Mongolia on November 5. He was admitted to hospital on Saturday, where he has been given several types of antibiotics to fight the disease, while being kept in isolation. Inner Mongolia health authority reported its third case of bubonic plague on Sunday after two other plague cases were revealed last week. It's the most common form of plague globally and can spread to lungs and cause the more severe pneumonic plague. The confirmation comes despite an earlier declaration by China's health chiefs that the risk of an outbreak of the killer disease was minimal. SCORES QUARANTINED The first two infected patients - still in quarantine - resulted in 46 of their close contacts being placed under medical observation. All but four have now been released. Plague can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of people infected if not treated promptly. The last major known outbreak in China was in 2009, when several people died in the town of Ziketan in Qinghai province on the Tibetan Plateau. In May this year, travellers were left stranded in Mongolia after an outbreak of deadly bubonic plague killed a couple after they ate an infected Marmot. Most read in world news Authorities in western Mongolia, which is close to the Russian frontier, instituted a quarantine to prevent the disease from spreading. American, Dutch, German, Swedish, Swiss, and South Korean tourists were marooned in Uglii as a result. How is the plague spread? Plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis - a bacteria usually found in small mammals and their fleas. Those infected with Y. pestis often develop symptoms after an incubaction period of one-to-seven days, says the World Health Organization. Symptoms include a sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, along with weakness and vomiting. The two main forms of plague infection are bubonic and pneumonic - where bubonic plague has spread to the lungs. Bubonic is the most common form and is where people develop painful swollen lymph nodes, or 'buboes'. At advanced stages of the infection, inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus. Plague is transmitted between animals and humans; by the bite of infected fleas; direct contact with infected tissues; and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets. Those suffering from bubonic plague have a 30-60 per cent chance of dying from the disease. Untreated pneumonic plague is \"always fatal\", says WHO. From 2010 to 2015 there were 3248 cases reported worldwide, including 584 deaths. Historically, plague was responsible for widespread pandemics with high mortality. It was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing more than 50 million deaths in Europe. Nowadays, plague is easily treated with antibiotics.","metadata":{"author":"Debbie White","categories":["News"],"date":"2019-11-18T00:00:00Z","description":"A HUNTER who killed and ate a wild rabbit in China has been hit by the deadly bubonic plague.
