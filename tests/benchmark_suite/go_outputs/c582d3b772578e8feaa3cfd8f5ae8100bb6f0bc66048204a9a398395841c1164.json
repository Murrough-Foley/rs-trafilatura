Here’s the thing … When you step into the online space, you’ll meet a whole new cast of characters. And they will try to sell you some pretty compelling stories. I'm here to tell you that the Laws of Physics apply to online business just like offline business.Click To Tweet It takes time to build a successful business — offline and online. (I know, radical statement, right?) I want you to embrace this reality — because I’m about to show you how to get time on your side. Trying to build an online business isn’t as simple as lots of people would have you believe. It has its challenges. There’s a lot of technology to master. There’s marketing involved — a lot of marketing. Maybe more marketing than you’re comfortable with. And there are all these moving parts — disparate bits of software that needs to interact to present your business and your offers seamlessly. Today, I’m going to demystify the process of building your online business. You’re about to save some major frustration, my friend. Money, too! Because it turns out your don’t need to Buy All The Things and Learn All The Things in order to make it online. I developed this approach to online business building after years of trial and error — mine, and the people I taught. It’s called Plan \u0026 Grow BIG. Focus on what really matters in the near future of your business Plan \u0026 Grow BIG helps you eliminate that feeling of overwhelm that might be stopping you from making real progress in your online business. Maybe you’re just getting started with your idea. Or maybe you’ve been trying for years to build a business idea you’ve had in your head — but it just isn’t living up to what you expected. Either way, you’re in the right place because today’s information will help you catapult forward. I developed this framework because I saw so many people who were getting sidetracked by online courses, programs, and books they felt they “needed” to master. For example, I saw people just starting out taking courses on Facebook ads — before they knew who they wanted to reach with those ads and what they were going to offer. And I also saw people trying to recruit affiliates before their product was proven in the marketplace. (No self-respecting affiliate will work to sell an unproven product.) I saw a lot of people wasting a lot of time. 🙁 Smart people! People who were accomplished in other areas of their lives. But they were completely baffled by this “online business thing.” To be perfectly honest, I recognized the need because I had lived the frustrations myself. True confession: I had to learn business focus the hard way Before I outline the Plan \u0026 Grow BIG approach and the specifics for each stage, you might be wondering how I figured this whole thing out. I’m going to share a bit of my story so you know how I came up with this. Back in late 2009, I was managing my booming design and marketing business, Zurek Design. I had national and regional clients and a roster of freelancers who I funneled projects to. I managed everything from my home office, where I was also juggling a new husband and two children who were rapidly approaching their “launch” phases — they were in high school and starting to look at universities and think about their careers. I didn’t have a lot of time to spare. Plus, the online business idea I had in mind was going to require me to become much more of a “public figure” than I had ever had to be in my business in the past. I’d have to put my photo on the internet, where anyone could see it! And I’d need to “put myself out there” on teleclasses, in interviews, on webinars, and in online video. Yikes. And although my offline business was making a solid income, my online business idea — to share my marketing and design training with others — wasn’t making a single cent. Who in their right mind invests in a business idea before they know if it will make money? I do, apparently! It turns out that I was more courageous than I knew. Because I did — I invested BIG in my idea when I purchased an online course called Teaching Sells. It was close to $2,000 at the time — an enormous amount of money to spend on what was basically just a dream at that point. But I’m glad I did. I truly believe that actions speak louder than words. And when I made that investment, I was telling myself, “This dream matters. This dream is going to become a reality. I’m taking this seriously.” Once I swallowed the fear of investing that much to learn something new, things started happening for me. Within a few months, I (the person who didn’t want to be seen online) had an article accepted by the company behind the course I took — on one of the most-popular websites in the world at the time, Copyblogger. Then another article went live. And another. Not just on Copyblogger but on many of the most-important online blogs of the day. And through it all, my audience grew. I began offering products and then coaching. Out with the old, in with the new (and better) Within a few years, my online business income eclipsed what my offline business made. By early 2014 I shuttered my offline business completely to focus exclusively on my online efforts. Now, I’m considered an authority on building an online presence. That company that I took the expensive course from? They hired me to teach their audience for a couple of years. Here’s what’s different in my life now: My business provides a very comfortable living for our family (and I can work in my pajamas) I am asked to speak and present my knowledge to audiences who are hungry to hear from me My books are well-received and much loved — and deliver income to me every single month People find my website and join my community every day, all year long I’m able to travel anywhere I’d like because my business fits in my backpack I can “dial up” or “dial back” my working hours as needed because I have complete control over my schedule Here’s the other important thing … I also have complete control over the direction I take my business. I answer to no one but myself! And I can adapt my offerings to what my audience needs whenever I’d like. But this story isn’t about me. What I’m about to share is the exact plan I’ve developed after seeing what truly works online. It’s the approach that has allowed me to build the business I have today. A business where I’m in control — of my time, my projects, my earnings. And that’s what I want for you. Ready to make online business building easier?

Build your first offer: Don’t build an elaborate, time-consuming first offer without doing a small test with a minimum viable version of it first! What can you create that’s relatively simple — but delivers a valuable solution to your ideal customer? Build that. Build an initial funnel: Build a way to attract prospects, serve them, and convert them to customers. And now … stop right there, my friend. In the BUILD stage, it’s tempting to look around at Version 9.0 of your competitors’ sites and feel like you have to catch up to them. Nonsense! They started at the beginning, just like you. Own where you are and be proud you’re ready to move on … The Implement Stage: Iterate to find what works Oooh, this stage is tricky. You are putting yourself out there! And it can feel deeply uncomfortable. But growth usually does feel uncomfortable, doesn’t it? The IMPLEMENT stage may last for a while and that’s perfectly fine. Here’s what you’ll focus on while you’re there: Make your offers live: Your goal with your first offers is to begin gathering feedback and data. If you earn a profit, great — but aim first to understand your customers and refine your offers to serve their needs. Focus on building your email list. Most online businesses need a robust list of people to make their offers to because only a small percentage will actually buy. At this stage, you should explore innovative ways to grow your subscriber list — think webinars, guest posts, challenges, etc. The exception to email list building? If you offer a customized service to an exclusive group of people, you can focus on building a referral network. Discover what works for launching your products and services. Launches are a nerve-wracking but important facet of online business. Aim to discover what launch techniques work best for your audience. Remember, this may be the longest of all the stages for you. It takes time to develop, offer, iterate, and adapt to the people you attract to your business. Patience, my friend! But once you’ve hit on a winning product or service, you’ll be ready for … The Grow Stage: Leverage your success In the GROW stage, you’ve hit on a product or service that converts reliably in your business — and now you’ll focus on leveraging that success. Improve your conversion rates: Your focus in the GROW stage will be to improve conversion rates across the board. You want to double down and do more of what’s working. You’ll iterate and adapt so you can make everything convert at the highest rate possible. Add more revenue streams: As you dial into what’s working well, you may uncover your customers’ unmet needs and build additional lines of business to serve them. You’ll move through the BUILD, IMPLEMENT, and GROW stages as you develop each new revenue stream. The GROW stage is a pretty amazing place to be! At this stage, revenues are reliable and you’re able to make some serious investments in your business. Ready? Set? Business focus!
