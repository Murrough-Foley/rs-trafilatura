Assange is battling extradition to the United States, which accuses him of publishing secret documents related to his WikiLeaks work. He had been facing the rape charge in Sweden since 2010. The case was dropped in 2017 with no charges being brought against Assange because the Swedish judicial officials were not able to proceed while the Australian national remained in London.

The journalist had also faced a probe surrounding a second sex-related allegation, which was dropped in 2015 because time had run out. Assange has denied both allegations. He is currently serving a prison term in Britain for skipping bail. The US wants the UK to extradite Assange, 47, over his alleged role in the release of classified military and diplomatic material in 2010. The US Justice Department has charged Assange with espionage by publishing hundreds of thousands of secret military and diplomatic files about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He now faces a maximum sentence of 175 years in prison in the US if convicted of all the charges against him there.
