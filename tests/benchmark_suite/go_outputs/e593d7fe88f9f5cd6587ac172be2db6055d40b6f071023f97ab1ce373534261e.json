That means people with the disorder will likely need a treatment plan designed by a medical professional to overcome it. People who are diagnosed with BED experience episodes of eating unusually large amounts, even when they’re not hungry. After an episode, they may feel a strong sense of guilt or shame. Regular binge episodes can lead to weight gain, which can contribute to health conditions like diabetes and heart disease. Fortunately, there are plenty of strategies you can try — both at home and with the help of a professional — to reduce episodes of binge eating. Here are 15 tips to help overcome binge eating. 1. Ditch the diet Fad diets can often be very unhealthy, and studies show that overly restrictive eating methods may trigger episodes of binge eating. For example, one study in 496 adolescent girls found that fasting was associated with a higher risk of binge eating ( Similarly, another study in 103 women noticed that abstaining from certain foods resulted in increased cravings and a higher risk of overeating ( Instead of following diets that focus on cutting out entire food groups or significantly slashing calorie intake to lose weight quickly, focus on making healthy changes. Eat more whole, unprocessed foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and moderate your intake of treats rather than excluding them from your diet altogether. This can help reduce binge eating and promote better health. Summary Studies show that fasting or eliminating certain foods from your diet may be associated with increased cravings and overeating. Focus on eating healthy foods instead of dieting or cutting out certain foods completely. 2. Avoid skipping meals Setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it is one of the most effective ways to overcome binge eating. Skipping meals can contribute to cravings and increase the risk of overeating. One small, 2-month study showed that eating one large meal per day increased levels of blood sugar and the hunger-stimulating hormone ghrelin to a greater extent than eating three meals per day ( Another study in 38 people found that adhering to a regular eating pattern was associated with a decreased frequency of binge eating ( Try setting a regular eating schedule and sticking to it. Summary Adhering to a regular eating pattern can reduce the risk of overeating and may be associated with lower levels of ghrelin and fasting blood sugar. 3. Practice mindfulness Mindfulness is a practice that involves listening to your body and paying attention to how you feel at the moment. This technique can prevent overeating by helping a person learn to recognize when they no longer feel hungry. One review of 14 studies found that practicing mindfulness meditation decreased the incidence of binge eating and emotional eating ( Another small study showed that combining mindfulness with cognitive behavioral therapy may improve eating behavior and self-awareness ( Try listening to your body to recognize when hunger tapers off. Additionally, try to eat slowly and enjoy food to promote healthy eating behaviors. Summary Practicing mindfulness can help you recognize when you’re no longer hungry, which can improve your eating behaviors and reduce the incidence of binge eating. 4. Stay hydrated Drinking plenty of water throughout the day is a simple yet effective way to curb cravings and stop overeating. In fact, studies show that increasing water intake could be linked to decreased hunger and calorie intake. For example, one study in 24 older adults found that drinking 17 ounces (500 ml) of water before eating a meal decreased the number of calories consumed by 13%, compared with a control group ( Similarly, another study in older adults showed that drinking 13–17 ounces (375–500 ml) of water 30 minutes before a meal significantly decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing feelings of fullness during the day ( Other studies indicate that drinking more water can boost metabolism and weight loss ( The amount of water each person should drink daily depends on various factors. Thus, it’s best to listen to your body and drink when you feel thirsty to ensure you’re staying well hydrated. Summary Drinking more water can keep you feeling full to decrease calorie intake and prevent binge eating. 5. Try yoga Yoga is a practice that incorporates both the body and mind by using specific breathing exercises, poses, and meditation to reduce stress and enhance relaxation. Studies indicate that yoga can help encourage healthy eating habits and reduce the risk of emotional eating. One small study in 50 people with BED showed that practicing yoga for 12 weeks led to a significant reduction in binging ( Another study in 20 girls found that combining yoga with outpatient eating disorder treatment decreased depression, anxiety, and body image disturbances — all of which could be factors involved in emotional eating ( Research also shows that yoga can decrease levels of stress hormones like cortisol to keep stress under control and prevent binge eating ( Try joining a local yoga studio to start adding this type of exercise to your routine. You can also use online resources and videos to practice at home. Summary Yoga can help prevent binge eating and may reduce common triggers like stress, depression, and anxiety. 6. Eat more fiber Fiber moves slowly through your digestive tract, keeping you feeling full longer ( Some research suggests that increasing fiber intake could cut cravings, reduce appetite, and food intake. One small, 2-week study found that supplementing twice daily with a type of fiber found in vegetables decreased hunger and calorie intake while increasing fullness ( Another study in 10 adults showed that taking 16 grams of prebiotic fiber daily increased levels of specific hormones that influence satiety and significantly reduced feelings of hunger ( Fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are just a few fiber-rich foods that can keep you feeling full. Summary Fiber can help keep you feeling full to reduce calorie intake and feelings of hunger. 7. Clean out the kitchen Having lots of junk food or trigger foods in the kitchen can make it much easier to binge eat. Conversely, keeping healthy foods on hand can reduce your risk of emotional eating by limiting the number of unhealthy options. Start by clearing out processed snack foods like chips, candies, and pre-packaged convenience foods and swapping them for healthier alternatives. Stocking your kitchen with fruits, vegetables, protein-rich foods, whole grains, nuts, and seeds can improve your diet and reduce your risk of binge eating unhealthy foods. Summary Removing unhealthy foods from your kitchen and stocking up on healthy alternatives can improve diet quality and make it harder to binge eat. 8. Start hitting the gym Studies indicate that adding exercise to your routine could prevent binge eating. For instance, one 6-month study in 77 people showed that increasing weekly exercise frequency stopped binge eating in 81% of participants ( Another study in 84 women found that pairing cognitive behavioral therapy with regular exercise was significantly more effective at reducing the frequency of binge eating than therapy alone ( Plus, other research suggests that exercise can decrease stress levels and enhance mood to prevent emotional eating ( Walking, running, swimming, biking, and playing sports are just a few different forms of physical activity that can help relieve stress and reduce binge eating. Summary Studies show that exercising can reduce the risk of binge eating and decrease stress levels. 9. Eat breakfast every day Starting each day off with a healthy breakfast might reduce the risk of binge eating later in the day. Several studies have found that maintaining a regular eating pattern is associated with less binge eating and lower levels of ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates feelings of hunger ( Plus, filling up on the right foods can keep you feeling full to curb cravings and reduce hunger throughout the day. For example, one study in 15 people found that eating a high-protein breakfast reduced levels of ghrelin to a greater extent than eating a high carb breakfast ( Meanwhile, eating fiber- and protein-rich oatmeal was shown to improve appetite control and promote fullness in another study in 48 people ( Try combining a few fiber-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, or whole grains, with a good source of protein to avoid overeating. Summary Eating a fiber- and protein-rich breakfast can prevent cravings and keep you satisfied throughout the morning. 10. Get enough sleep Sleep affects your hunger levels and appetite, and sleep deprivation may be linked to binge eating. In fact, one study in 146 people found that those with BED reported significantly more symptoms of insomnia than people without a history of this condition ( Another large study showed that shorter sleep duration was associated with higher levels of the hunger hormone ghrelin and lower levels of leptin — the hormone responsible for promoting fullness. Additionally, sleeping less than 8 hours per night was linked to higher body weight ( Aim to squeeze in at least 8 hours per night to keep your appetite in check and reduce your risk of binge eating. Summary BED may be linked to increased symptoms of insomnia. Sleep deprivation has been shown to alter the levels of hormones that affect hunger and appetite. 11. Keep a food and mood journal Keeping a food and mood journal that tracks what you eat and how you feel can be an effective tool.
