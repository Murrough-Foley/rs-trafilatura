You can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or Apple\u0026#39;s AirPlay 2 to stream music through the Move, regardless of how close the nearest power outlet is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eAmazon Echo Buds for $130\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSee it now:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmazon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn many ways, 2019 was the year of wireless earbuds.
