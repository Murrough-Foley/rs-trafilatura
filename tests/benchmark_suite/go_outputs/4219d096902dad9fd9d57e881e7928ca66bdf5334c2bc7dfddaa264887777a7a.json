However, it would have been helpful if you had included the amount of prepared fruit. I had to guess. My pears came from a friend’s tree and were all different sizes. I used approximately 7 cups of fruit, which I think could’ve been a little more than needed, but still turned out good. The recipe calls for 6 tablespoons of fruit pectin which is one tablespoon more than a box of Sure Jell. I had to open another box for 1 tablespoon. I really hated doing that. I will have to find something that uses less than a box. Someone who is new to jam making might have a bit of a problem with this recipe. It was worth the effort, but needs a little more information. The cook time after the honey is added should also be included in the recipe. Thanks for sharing it; I’m glad that I had an opportunity to try it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHi Cherie,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m glad you liked it and thanks for your feedback. I used a jar of pectin so the number of tablespoons I used was my personal preference for consistency, but if you are using a box then you could probably do with just the five tablespoons if the consistency is to your liking with that amount.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/body\u003e","commentsText":"2 comments I made this jam today and it turned out really good.

Not to be confused with a 1990s grunge band, pear jam is a delicious gift to give for the holidays. With notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and clove, this \u003cstrong\u003ehoney pear jam\u003c/strong\u003e recipe will have you spreading Yuletide cheer in no time! It’s so easy and delicious that you’ll want to make some extra for yourself! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIs there anything better than a piece of toast or a biscuit topped with a dollop of jam? Especially \u003cem\u003ehomemade jam\u003c/em\u003e. Not many things are more homey and comforting than jam that has been made in someone’s kitchen. Up until not too long ago, I used to think that people who made their own jam must be wizards. Jam has always seemed like one of those things that only other people made, and then I tried it. Honestly, it’s so easy that anyone can do it with a few simple ingredients and not much equipment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRelated post: Pickled Brussels Sprouts Recipe\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWHAT YOU NEED TO MAKE JAM\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you make jam in a pot? A pressure canner? I don’t know. Help!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe simple answer is that foods with low acidity need to be canned in a pressure canner. For this jam, though, all you need is an inexpensive water bath canner with a rack. A water bath canner is really just a big porcelain stockpot that will hold about ten canning jars depending on their size. They also come with a rack that makes removing your jars easier and keeps them from coming in contact with the bottom of the canner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the canner pot, you will need some mason jars (I prefer 8-ounce jelly jars), a ladle, and something to remove the hot jars from boiling water. You could get creative or just use a jar lifter which is a nifty set of tongs made specifically to fit over mason jars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMAKING SPICED HONEY PEAR JAM\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that you have your equipment, you will need the ingredients. About 8 ripe pears, a fresh lemon, fruit pectin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, ground cloves, and a 16-ounce Don Victor® Orange Blossom Comb Honey Globe Jar. Before getting your jam mixture ready, fill your canner to the line on the inside and set it to simmer. Add your jelly jars and let them get warm while you make your jam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCube and peel the pears with a paring knife and put them in a large pot. To the pears, add the juice of one lemon and spices. Stir together and taste test it to make sure your flavors are where you want them to be before adding the fruit pectin powder. Heat to boiling for a minute or so to combine the spices and pears, then add a jar Don Victor® Honey, or about a cup and a half. Let the mixture boil until thickened on the back of a spoon, or about 5-8 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHOW TO USE A WATER BATH CANNER\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen your jam mixture is the correct consistency, use a ladle to transfer the mixture into the warm and sterilized jelly jars. I may or may not have been going a little too fast and spilled some hot jam on my hand. I don’t recommend that, so please pour slowly and carefully.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that your jars are filled, put the tops on, lower the rack into the canner, and use your jar lifter to lower the jars into the water one at a time. Turn the stove up from simmering to boil the jars for *10 minutes. If you live at an altitude of more than 1000 feet as I do, you will need to adjust your boiling time. There are altitude charts available online. We are at 5280 feet in Denver so I boiled mine for 20 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRemove the jars from the boiling water and let them cool for several hours. If your jam looks runny, don’t worry. It will thicken as it cools. It could take 24-48 hours to really look like jam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGIVING THE GIFT OF HOMEMADE JAM\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you choose to gift your honey pear jam to friends and family, there are so many ways you can present your gift. Make cute labels, put it in a gift basket, or add a piece of fabric and a ribbon to dress up the jar and pass them out to your friends and family. No matter how you choose to present your gift, it’s sure to be a winner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDecorating the top of your jelly jars with fabric is super simple. Cut a piece of fabric in a circle to use as a cover for your jelly jars and fasten with a ribbon to make them extra festive. Set them aside in a pretty basket if you wish, ready to hand out to your friends, family, and coworkers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eUSING HONEY INSTEAD OF SUGAR\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI like to use honey because it has more flavor than sugar. In general, when substituting honey for sugar in a recipe you will use about half the amount. For instance, the original recipe for this jam called for three cups of sugar, but I only use a cup and a half of honey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth the pear jam and honey are a delicious addition to toast, biscuits, or homemade vanilla scones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eSpiced Honey Pear Jam\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIngredients\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e8-9 ripe pears, cored and peeled\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 lemon, or about 1/4 cup lemon juice\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e6 tbsp fruit pectin powder\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 tsp cinnamon\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 tsp nutmeg\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 tsp ground ginger\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1/2 tsp ground cloves\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e1 jar Don Victor® Honey, or 1 1/2 cups\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003eInstructions\u003c/h3\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eFill canner with water and set it to simmer.
