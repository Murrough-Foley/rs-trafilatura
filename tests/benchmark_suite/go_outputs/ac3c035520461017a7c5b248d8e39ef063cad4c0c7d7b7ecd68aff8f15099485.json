There is no significant difference in reports of reckless driving or passenger complaints between the treatment and control vehicles. There is also no significant difference in maximum moving speeds. However, the average moving speed was slower for treatment vehicles than control vehicles, by about 1 km/h on average.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReductions in average speed at levels similar to that referenced above are small enough that we don’t model the disutility. That said, this study raises the question of the mechanism by which accidents are reduced, if speeds don’t change. Our question about the mechanism by which the reduction in accidents occurred is one of our key uncertainties about the program, and is one of the factors that led us to discount our best-guess effect of the intervention more than for most programs with RCTs we’ve looked at.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCatherine (GiveWell)\u003c/strong\u003eon September 20, 2018 at 10:07 am said:\u003cp\u003eHi Gary,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe detailed several considerations related to giving now versus later in this 2011 blog post.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe see the following general arguments in favor of giving now and giving later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn favor of giving now:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e* It may become less cost-effective to help people in the future, due to general economic development and improvements in living conditions, and so some of the best opportunities to save or improve a life today may not exist in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e* Accomplishing good today may “earn interest,” by empowering people and positioning them to help others in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn favor of giving later:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e* We might find more cost-effective programs in the future, through our Incubation Grants program or by researching and reviewing new areas, such as policy advocacy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e* An opportunity that looks good now could look worse in the future (for example, because we learn new information or because it runs out of room for more funding).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn balance, our best guess is that the benefits of giving now are likely to outweigh the benefits of giving later, although we have a high degree of uncertainty around this.
