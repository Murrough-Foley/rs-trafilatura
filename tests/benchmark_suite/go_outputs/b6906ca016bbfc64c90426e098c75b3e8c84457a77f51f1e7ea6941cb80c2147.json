Thanks to my tariffs, we\u0026#39;re taking in billions and billions of dollars from a country that never gave us 10 cents, China.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBackers of tariffs say that they help American companies become more competitive with their foreign counterparts. As those companies prosper, the thinking goes, they can hire more workers and pay their employees better. Those workers, in turn, would have more money to spend, and that helps spread those dollars around the economy more broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTariffs have also strengthened the United States’ leverage after massive job losses from China trade in recent decades, said Scott Paul, who heads the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a group that has applauded some of Trump’s tariff decisions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost mainstream economists, however, argue that consumers are the primary victims of tariffs. Tariffs on consumer products hit customers directly, while tariffs on raw materials can produce delays or price spikes that spiral across the economy, interrupting complex and time-sensitive supply chains. Any slowdown in the supply chain could mean layoffs for producers and a hit to the broader U.S. economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;As a general matter, import tariffs are a tax,\u0026#34; said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University’s Stern School of Business. \u0026#34;Tariffs, like any tax, generally introduce an inefficiency and makes the two sides of the trading relationship poorer — not richer.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStudies have shown that lower-income Americans tend to purchase a larger fraction of their income on goods. That means they could feel the pinch worse than more affluent Americans do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe situation can worsen if other countries raise trade barriers against the United States, thus hurting U.S. companies that export to the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the United States slaps tariffs on goods, it isn’t foreign exporters that make the payment. The importers do, and they’re usually U.S. companies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;If the U.S. imposes a tariff on Chinese televisions, the duty is paid to U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the border by a U.S. broker representing a U.S. importer — say, Costco,\u0026#34; Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, has written. \u0026#34;The Chinese government pays nothing.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCustoms and Border Protection typically requires payment within 10 days of their shipments clearing customs, Reuters reported. Companies that don’t pay their amount by that date are sent a new bill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the tariff is small, an importer may elect to keep its prices stable rather than pass the tariff cost along to the consumer. But when tariffs are high enough, firms will inevitably pass on some or all of the increase to U.S. consumers, said Monica de Bolle, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, tariffs could mean that producers pay more, as materials that are used to make products sold in the United States rise in price. Those price increases are likely to be passed on to consumers as well. It’s possible that U.S. consumers could find tariff-free products elsewhere, but in many cases, a suitable product may not be available, or may be more expensive or of lower quality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRevenues from the Trump-imposed tariffs have totaled about $63 billion through June 30, 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s much higher than the revenue level before Trump began imposing tariffs. For context, that’s less than 2% of annual federal revenues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoreover, some of that money has been spent on payments to farmers hit by retaliatory Chinese tariffs, to the tune of $28 billion over the past two years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we’ve noted, a March 2019 study by the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a London-based think tank, concluded that, using standard economic methods, \u0026#34;the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers, with a reduction in U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month by the end of 2018.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeparately, the Congressional Budget Office projects that the Trump-era tariffs will reduce the national gross domestic product by 0.3 percent by 2020.

The conservative-leaning Tax Foundation projected in May that the tariffs imposed so far by the Trump administration would reduce GDP by 0.25 percent or $63.1 billion, while lowering wages by 0.16 percent and eliminating 195,600 full-time-equivalent jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the U.S. bears the brunt from tariffs, China stands to suffer, too.
