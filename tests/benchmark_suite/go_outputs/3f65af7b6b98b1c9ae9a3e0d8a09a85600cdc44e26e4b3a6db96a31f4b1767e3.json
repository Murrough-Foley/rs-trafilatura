(We never did settle on one, unlike our 565 municipalities, which are packed with them.) Enter South Dakota to throw down the gauntlet. The state’s new slogan for an anti-drug campaign drew a South Dakota-sized share of attention on social media Monday. Just what is this priceless slogan? “Meth. We’re on it.” Yes, that’s it. No joke. The governor of South Dakota would like us to know that her state is on meth. You know, like solving the problem. On it ! Of course, you might just be able to see the issue here, besides the fact that Florida Man will have to up the ante next time. And if you haven’t yet noticed what might be wrong, a whole lot of people on Twitter pointed it out. So many people were talking about South Dakota’s odd new slogan that the state and “We’re On It\" became top Twitter trends. According to a report in the Argus Leader of Sioux Falls, Gov. Kristi Noem launched the campaign on Monday in an effort to address the state’s meth crisis. “Meth. We’re on it” is rolling out with TV commercials and billboards in which people say, “I’m on meth.” The report says the Minneapolis ad agency Broadhead Co. came up with the campaign, and the state has paid the agency nearly $449,000 so far this year. Noem saw the Twitter reaction and ... doubled down on the slogan. “Hey Twitter, the whole point of this ad campaign is to raise awareness,” Noem tweeted. “So I think that’s working.” She proceeded to share the hashtag #MethWeAreOnIt and onmeth.com, the website for the initiative, which contains the following statement: “South Dakota has a problem. There isn’t a single solution because meth is widespread. But we can approach it from different angles, so it doesn’t take over counties, towns, neighborhoods. Let’s work together. Meth. We’re on it.” Still, this isn’t the first time a slogan has gone awry in South Dakota. Consider this 2014 entry — “Don’t jerk and drive,\" meant to discourage drivers from jerking the wheels of their cars while traveling on icy roads. The road safety slogan was an intentional play for a double entendre, but drew enough criticism to get the ax from the state Department of Public Safety. Have a tip?
